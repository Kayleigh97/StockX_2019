Jupyter Notebook for the StockX 2019 Data Contest.

From the contest page: 
" The data we’re giving you consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 (the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection) and the present. There are 99,956 total sales in the data set; 27,794 Off-White sales, and 72,162 Yeezy sales. The sample consists of U.S. sales only.
...
To create this sample, we took a random, fixed percentage of StockX sales (X%) for each colorway, on each day, since September 2017. So, for each day the Off-White Jordan 1 was on the market, we randomly selected X% of its sale from each day. (It’s not important to know what X is; all that matters is that it’s a random sample, and that the same fixed X% of sales was selected from every day, for every sneaker).

We’ve included 8 variables for you to work with: Order Date, Brand, Sneaker Name, Sale Price ($), Retail Price ($), Release Date, Shoe Size, and Buyer State (the U.S. state the buyer shipped to). You can use whatever variables you want in the analysis; you can use 1 variable, or you can use all 8. And remember, every row in the spreadsheet represents an individual StockX sale. There are no averages or order counts; this is just a random sample of daily sales data. "
